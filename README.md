# OnlyDevs

## Description

This project aims to create a platform that allows users to browse, purchase, and access a variety of educational courses in both video and text formats. The courses can be taught by anyone, and we will not set limitations on the subject. The platform will feature a user-friendly interface and will potentially offer various features such as course recommendations and progress tracking.
