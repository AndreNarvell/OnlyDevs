# OnlyDevs

## Description

This project aims to create a platform that allows users to browse, purchase, and access a variety of educational courses in both video and text formats. The courses can be taught by anyone, and we will not set limitations on the subject. The platform will feature a user-friendly interface and will potentially offer various features such as course recommendations and progress tracking.


## Demo

https://onlydevs.vercel.app/

When purchasing write "4242 4242 4242 4242" as card number and then 12/31 and 123 as CVC

### Payment

#### ⚠ Do not use real card details!

When testing interactively, use a card number, such as 4242 4242 4242 4242. Enter the card number in the Dashboard or in any payment form.ils!

Use a valid future date, such as 12/34.
Use any three-digit CVC (four digits for American Express cards).
Use any value you like for other form fields.
